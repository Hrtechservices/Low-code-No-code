Even while it's unclear whether all companies will have mobile apps, there is a growing emphasis on customer-focused mobile applications as the world turns more and more toward technology.
Low-code no-code platforms enable businesses to create apps using visual development rather than opting for an alternate development path that requires the addition of multiple lines of code. No-code software development and low-code app development work amazingly well together.

Low Code Development
It is a modular approach to software development where code blocks are carefully chosen and connected to create an application, website, or service. Although low code development platforms involve some coding, they are more easily accessible to developers, allowing them to create new apps in the shortest amount of time.

No-Code Development
No-code development uses a drag-and-drop process that could not even require any prior coding expertise or knowledge, which is highly advantageous for non-developers! Platforms with no code programming enable teams and enterprises to build software entirely from functional and reusable building blocks.
